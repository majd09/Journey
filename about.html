    <h3 class="text-center">Český Krumlov</h3></br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
      <p>The name Krumlov is said to have originated from the German "Krumme Aue," which translates to "crooked meadow." The town's naturally occurring topography—more especially, the Vltava River's tightly winding meander—is the source of the town's name. Instead of Moravian or Silesian, the word "Český" simply means Czech, or Bohemian (which are actually one and the same). It was referred to as Crumlovia or Crumlovium in Latin documents. Documents from 1253 were the first to mention Krumlov, then known as Chrumbonowe.
      </p>
      <p>The Vltava River's flow has long served as this area's natural transportation entryway. The earliest known settlement in the region dates to the Older Stone Age, between 70,000 and 50,000 B.C. The Bronze Age (1,500 B.C.) saw widespread settlement, the Younger Iron Age (ca. 400 B.C.) saw Celtic settlements, and the sixth century A.D. saw the beginning of Slavonic settlement. Boletice and Doudleby were the two tribes that represented the Slavs.
      </p>
      <p>In the Early Middle Ages the routes along the Vltava river created the trade routes. In the 9th century the area was probably owned by the noble Czech family of Slavníkovci, who were slaughtered by the rival family of Přemyslovci in 995. This area then became their property. In accordance with the principles of internal colonization and bestowing of sovereign domains in fief to members of a sovereign dynasty, this domain was thus given by the ruling family of Přemyslovci to one of their own lines - The Witigonen in Czech known as the Vítkovci.
      </p>
      <p>The legend states that the Witigonen family originated in ancient Rome. The Roman Ursini family, who are reported to have lived on the mountain "Mons Rosarum" close to Rome, was related to the family. The family left Rome after the Visigoth leader Totila's hordes plundered the city in 546. One of the family members, Vítek (Wittigon in German), traveled north with his wife and child, crossed the Donau river, and settled in Southern Bohemia. There, he established a new family and amassed vast domains over time, which, prior to his passing, he left to his five sons. Every son was given a coat-of-arms featuring a five-petaled rose, each representing a different dominion.
      </p>
      <p>Legend be damned; historical reality allows us a few minor deviations. Vítek arrived in South Bohemia in the 12th century, not the 6th, and his ancestry was not from the Italian Ursini family but rather from a Czech princess of the Přemyslovci. Vítek of Prčice appears to have been an envoy of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa in 1173; he settled in Southern Bohemia in 1179. Because his property did not have to return to the Přemysl family, his domains were exempt from the so-called law of escheat, demonstrating his strong influence. Vítek left his properties to his four sons, Jindřich of Hradec; Vítek, since he could dispose of them freely.
